# IDM
Python algorithms for hydrogeological and geophysical 3D data integration using geostatistical simulation and gradual deformation methods. Ultimately, the project allow spatiotemporal monitoring of the salt water intrusion interface for a better fresh water resources management at Magdalen Islands (Qc).
